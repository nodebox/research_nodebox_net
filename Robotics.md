<h1>Robotics</h1>

<p>Real-life robots are much more complex than algorithms. Aside from a decision logic they need robust skills to overcome the physical world as well. We try to test our drawing algorithms in real-life whenever we have a chance.</p>

<p>There's lots of coverage at the <a href="http://old.champdaction.be/cda.php?p=Blotter">Blotter</a> homepage, a project with drawing robots we did at the <a href="MuHKA">http://www.muhka.be/</a> Antwerp, Belgium, 2005. If you want some inspirational code, try the <a href="http://www.nodebox.net/code/index.php/Ants">ants</a> library on the NodeBox site.</p>
