<h1>Uniview Fonts</h1>

<p><a href="Uniview">Uniview</a> has both bitmap and truetype font support</p>

<h2>Bitmap fonts</h2>

<p>Bitmap fonts consist of a .png and a .adv file. The .png file is just an image containing all of the letters after eachother. The .adv file contains the size of each character in the file, as well as the order.</p>

<h2>Truetype fonts</h2>

<p>Truetype fonts are supported through PIL font support. A truetype font is rendered as an image map. Each drawn letter is a textured quad.</p>
