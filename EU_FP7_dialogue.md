<br>By the way, I do see Processing as an international effort: it was started at MIT, continued at Ivrea, and now at UCLA. Wiring and Arduino boards were developed at Ivrea and Mobile Processing was developed by an ex-Ivrea student. It developed so fast because of the strong web presence and help  contributed from all over the world. 
<br>
<br>I would not like to see Nodebox as a rival, but as complimentary, developing the things that Processing does not do so well and with the ability to interface with it. I see these as particularly the print-oriented aspect and the AI elements. 
<br>
<br>You mention having complimentary skills among the team. Our particular interest and strength is in interface design. We also have a thesis student at the moment who is using Processing for data visualisation, another interest of ours. 
<br>We have a colleague, Davide Rochesso, who has expertise in sound, if this should be of interest to the project. He is the coordinator of  a COST network in this area.
<br>
<br>In the notes you don't mention visual interfaces. This is an aspect which I think would be important in an application for visual output. </b></i></a></ul></li></pre></p><br /></div>
