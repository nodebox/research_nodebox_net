<p><!-- NOTITLE --> <span class="big_text">The strategy of NodeBox is to have a set of intelligent nodes that work together. Each node is an individual piece of software that makes a decision about a specific area of design.</span></p><p><span class="big_text"></span></p><hr />  <span class="big_text"></span><h2>Evolving ontology using loose tags</h2>  <p>We hope that with an open strategy, NodeBox and Gravital will result in lots of useful nodes. A tagging provides metadata on the type and quality of the nodes. This is inspired by the social bookmarking site <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>.</p>  <p><span class="media"><img src="/static/media/tagging-delicious.png" height="39" width="525" /></span> </p>  <p>Each node is specified with a URL, e.g. http://nodes.nodebox.net/color/prism/1.0/ . The URL can be any form, but it&#39;s a good idea to include a unique name and a version identifier at the end.</p>  <p>A set of tags can identify the specific areas this node relates to, e.g. &quot;color, lookup, google&quot;. Tags can be multiple words; each tag is seperated by a comma.</p>  <p>Next to a tag, the node can also be rated. We propose an up-down system like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>. No specific points can be given.</p>  <p><span class="media"><img src="/static/media/tagging-reddit.png" height="37" width="440" /></span> </p>  <hr />  <h2>Tagging </h2>  <p>(not the best name -- still searching for something else)</p>  <ul> <li>url: the URL of the node we refer to</li> <li>tags: a set of comma-seperated tags</li> <li>rating: either +1, 0, or -1. The default is 0 (no rating)</li> <li>time: a timestamp</li> <li>user: the user that tagged the node</li> </ul>
