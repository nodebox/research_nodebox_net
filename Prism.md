<p>"Prism has two parts: googlesort() and shade(). 
The googlesort() algorithm sorts items according to the result count Google yields on an item. As such, it assumes the entire internet is some sort of "emotive opinion" on the subject. In short, sorting "red", "green", and "blue" by "love" yields red as the highest result. Likely because red is the color commonly associated with love. The shade() algorithm maps formal terms like "light", "dark", "intense", "bright", "cool" to HSB saturation and brightness ranges. Now to tie things up, I could search Google for the rainbow colors. These I would sort by "apple", and sort the shade() terms by apple as well. Combining both should return the most applicable color with the most applicable shade to get some idea of what an apple looks like!"</p>

<p>Prism kan kleuren bedenken bij elk mogelijk onderwerp, bijvoorbeeld ook "liefde":</p>
