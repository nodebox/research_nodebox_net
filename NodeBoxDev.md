<p>We did some experimentation to create a version of NodeBox for Windows, written in Java uses <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> as the programming language. </p>

<p>This version lags behind the current state-of-the-art, and we're not actively developing this version. None of the libraries or examples are supported on this version. Use at your own risk.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: the first startup will take very long; NodeBox is caching all java libraries. This is only done once; after that, startup should be faster.</p>

<h1>Pre-Gravital environment</h1>

<p>Gravital sports a full graphical interface. It uses a graph to represent all its nodes. You can easily create your own nodes by combining already existing ones.</p>
