There is no joint goal yet but the main topic is the enhancement of creativity and creative content.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="big_text">Creativity for all.</span><br />We are looking to develop tools that allow a broad range of people to express their creativity without being limited to <i>a)</i> what a user-interface defines, <i>b)</i> programming skills, <i>c)</i> artistic skills. The starting point is the Gravital extension developed for <a href="http://nodebox.net" target="_self">NodeBox</a>.</p><ul><li>Users should be able to express creativity in natural language (i.e. plain English). <br /></li><li>Users can play around with building blocks in a node-based interface that produces visual output.</li><li>Techniques used in artificial intelligence aid users in formulating creative concepts.</li><li>Networks of commonsense data and design-related knowledge aid the AI-algorithms.</li><li>A library of realistic vector models tagged with keywords.</li><li>Physical interfaces, moving away from the mouse and keyboard.  </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="big_text">Grand unified generative art.</span><br />We want to establish a standardization of generative art. The right way to write code for graphic output,  rules on how color and composition work, API guidelines on how new libraries are coded (simple example: <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" target="_self">PEP 8</a>).</p><ul><li>A cross-platform application.</li><li>One standard API addresses OpenGL/PDF/sound or whatever else the given assigment requires. </li><li>The core graphics engine is enhanced with libraries for color theory, grid composition, typography, image finding, symmetry, ... The field of graphic design is unambiguously mapped to algorithms. <br /></li><li>Python Applet?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="big_text">Evolving community.</span><br />We want to create and promote a central place to share experience and creativity. A place that gathers knowledge, expands it, adapts to reflect new needs.<br /> </p><ul><li>An application that can talk to other applications (cfr. OSC).</li><li>Automatic publishing and sharing of user code and output.</li><li>Trends and machine learning: if all the experience is centralized, we can look at who is making what at a given time period in a given context. The system can adapt and improve (genetically?) based on this information. </li><li>Involving the Python community. <br /></li><li>Workshops. Establishment of a new educational institute for generative art (cfr. IVREA)?<br /></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><hr size="2" width="100%" /><p><span class="pink_box">Why</span></p><p>Computers enhance creativity yet current user interfaces and programming skills prove to be an <b>obstacle</b>. There is a need for new software that allows everyone and anyone to benefit from computational power.</p><p>People with the expertise in generative art are scattered and <b>isolated</b> across Europe. It is essential to streamline their expertise.</p><p>The obvious alternative, <a href="http://processing.org" target="_self">Processing</a> focuses on aesthetic visual output rather than semantic and conceptual creativity. </p><p>There is a need in science for good <b>data visualization</b> tools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr size="2" width="100%" /><p>Partners in our proposal can share their ideas here.
