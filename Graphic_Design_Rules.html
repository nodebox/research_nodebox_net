<br />A semantic network describing concepts, relations and processes in the
field of graphic design.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  To be able to expand a machine&#39;s understanding of design related concepts
  like composition, typography, color we are experimenting with semantic
  networks. A semantic network is a form of knowledge representation in which
  concepts are hierarchically connected to each other with semantic relations.
  In analogy to WordNet, we use relations like <i>is-a</i>, <i>is-part-of</i>,
  <i>is-opposite-of</i>, <i>is-related-to</i> and <i>is-same-as</i> to describe
  how the design process works.
</p>
<p>
  The machine can browse through the network and use it&#39;s knowledge to make
  founded decisions.

<h1>Perceptonyms</h1>
<p>
  All of the relations we use are common in semantic networks except for the
  <i>perceptonymy</i>. We coined the term perceptonym (Gravital research
  project, 2007) as a way to link language to visual output.
</p>
<p>
  At one end in the graphic design workflow are conceptual constraints like
  <i>bright</i> and <i>trendy</i> colors, at the other end are technological
  possibilities like a <i>HSB color model</i>. We can easily define
  <i>bright</i> in terms of saturation and brightness, and <i>trendy</i> in
  terms of specific hues (like pink). Hence, <i>bright</i> and <i>trendy</i> are
  perceptonyms that link language to software possibilities. They can be used to
  teach a machine something about aesthetics.

    >A perceptonym is a word that can be seen, felt, heard, smelled, or
    experienced emotionally. Perceptonyms occur in pairs of opposites like
    bright-dark and large-small. We can use them to translate language to visual
    output.</span

<h1>WordNet</h1>
<p>
  One of the systems we use is WordNet. With WordNet we can find out about
  linguistical synonyms of concepts in a text, and once we have a synonym that
  matches a perceptonym we can continue unravelling the concept in the
  design-specific network.

<h1>Contextual links</h1>
<p>
  Another, wilder type of network creates contextual links between textual
  descriptions. If one description has some chunks of words that also appear in
  another description, the noun in that chunk becomes a link between the
  described concepts.
</p>
<p>
  This type of network is highly effective with opinions, feelings, personal
  tastes and other non-scientific data. The example below shows the relations in
  a dream dictionary.

<h1>Perception</h1>
<p>
  The heart of the commonsense network is a handcrafted set of sensory data
  describing relations between graphic design concepts such as typography and
  photography. These we connect to programming code (e.g. a font selector, a
  grid algorithm, an image finder, ...) to create visual output.
