<h1>Computers and the Zen of Programming Art</h1>

<p><strong>Experiments into programming, art and artificial intelligence, looking for life inside the machine.</strong></p>

<p>This book bundles a series of computer algorithms that produce visual, natural, and evolving, art. The code was developed by Lucas Nijs, Frederik De Bleser and Tom De Smedt at the St. Lucas School of Arts, Antwerp, Belgium as part of their research.</p>

<h1>Flowerewolf</h1>

<p><strong>Oekandana</strong> is a Belgian poetry collective initiated by Tom De Smedt, Frederik De Bleser and Lucas Nijs. The three of them form the core of a research group at the St. Lucas School of Arts in Antwerp, Belgium. Their research deals with graphic design, language, and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Everything in this book (not including this text) was generated by a program called <strong>Flowerewolf</strong>, from the consonance between verse words, to page layout and image creation, no human was involved.</p>

<p>So, no, we do not have a clue as to what marital pictures have to do with poetry.</p>
